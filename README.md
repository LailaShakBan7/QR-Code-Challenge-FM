## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

It was my first attempt in coding and it was tricky to choose the right properties in css to get the body and the .card to work and be seen as the original display.

At the end, I think I have a done a good job and I am open to feedbacks/comments.

```html

.container {
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 350px;
}

.card {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0 1rem;
}
```
### Continued development

I will definitely keep practicing and trying new challenges to improve my skills.

### Useful resources

I watched a few videos on Youtube that most definitely helped me along in this challenge.
